- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will provide a modern, machined, objective, and neutral look appropriate for both headlines and body text.
- Utilize minimalist, clear icons to represent different aspects of the arms race, such as missiles, treaties, and geographical locations. The icons will be animated to subtly draw attention and enhance user engagement.
- Implement a modular layout, inspired by Bugatti's website, ensuring content is presented in an easily digestible manner. Each section will transition smoothly into the next, maintaining user immersion.
- Incorporate fluid, high-quality animations throughout the site. Elements will fade in, slide, and transition smoothly, similar to Bugattiâ€™s site, to maintain user engagement and provide a sophisticated feel.
